# Laborator 2

Tasks:
- [x] Compulsory
  - [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem.
  - [x] Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters.
  - [x] The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes.
  - [x] Create and print on the screen the objects in the example.
- [ ] Homework
  - [x] Create a class that describes an instance of the problem
  - [x] Override the equals method from the Object class for the Event and Room classes.
  - [x] The problem should not allow adding the same event or room twice
  - [x] Create dedicated classes for lecture halls and computer labs. Room will become abstract.
  - [x] Create a class to describe the solution
  - [x] Implement a simple algorithm for creating a feasible solution to the problem, "trying" to minimize the number of used rooms
  - [ ] Write doc comments in your source code and generate the class documentation using javadoc.
- [ ] Bonus
  - [ ] Use the time package in order to describe the start and the end time of the events.
  - [ ] Implement the DSatur graph coloring algorithm
  - [ ] Generate large random instances and:
    - [ ] compare the solutions generated by greedy and DSatur algorithms;
    - [ ] analyze the performance of your algorithm (running times, memory consumption). Identify the hot-spots in your code.
